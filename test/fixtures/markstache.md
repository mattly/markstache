I think the [sandwich][] has to be one of my *favorite* forms of food. My
favorite has to be the {{ sandwiches.favorite.title }} and I particularly like
the ones from {{ references.bunk.title }}.

My wife prefers {{ sandwiches.blt.title }}, and although she doesn't like eating
Lamb, I think she would like to try an MLT sometime. After all:

Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice MLT --
[mutton][], {{ greens }} and tomato sandwich -- where the mutton is nice and
lean and the tomato is ripe.
